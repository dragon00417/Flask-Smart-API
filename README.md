# NeuralPy
A Keras like library work on top of PyTorch

Currently, this library is at a very early stage of development. I'll add a proper README later.

## NeuralPy Release Plan
Here is a list if things that I want to add in the library before the `0.1.0-alpha` release.
  * [ ] Models
    * [ ] Sequential
  * [ ] Layers
    * [x] Linear
      * [x] Dense
    * [ ] Convolutional
      * [ ] Conv1D
      * [ ] Conv2D
      * [ ] Conv3D
    * [ ] Pooling
      * [ ] MaxPool1D
      * [ ] MaxPool2D
      * [ ] MaxPool3D
      * [ ] AvgPool1D
      * [ ] AvgPool2D
      * [ ] AvgPool3D
  * [ ] Regulariziers
  * [ ] Activation Functions
  * [ ] Loss Functions
  * [ ] Optimizers
  * [ ] Generator Training
  * [ ] Sample code and Blogs
  * [ ] Proper README
